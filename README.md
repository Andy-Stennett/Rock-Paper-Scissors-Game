Welcome,

Introduction:

This is the readme file for the rock, Paper scissors game I wrote for the second project. It should be noted that as a:) the game is not informational and not really suited for auto readers, and b:) because it is a visual game the same applies, I have not written alt text anywhere, as there seems no point.
At the start of the game, simple graphic appears showing layout, icons for the play pieces to choose from on the left and two circles to depict where the player's and computer choises of weapon will be. I could have left them blank but for the purposes of this project I let them stay.
Full screen mode:

Instructions for the game and what to expect:

The player is requested to choose a weapon by clicking on an icon. This is replicated in the 'arena section' in the middle, along with a random selection from the computer, the icons are compared, a result message is output underneath and scores are added to. When a either player or computer score reaches 5 the game is over and a winner announced, along with an instruction to reset the game and start over.

Issues and possible additions:
I was unable to find a relevant backgroung graphic to depict two players, and time restrictions meant I couldn't draw one with Affinity. Same wth a logo. So the game screen is quite basic.
Seems to be a quirk that alerts (to inform of winning/losing the match) appear before the final score is added.
I'm not sure whether a timer is a necessary addition so I haven't added one.
Also not added as there is no point, is a 404 page, or a favicon as there are no links to lose.

Acknowledgements:
I used the Lugrasimo font from Google's free collection. 
The icons from the weapons came from FontAwesome.
I gleaned useful tips from the W3 website, such as adding HTML using JS, and also from the LoveMaths project.
I am also indebted to @Daisy_mentor and @Tomas_K_Alumni_Lead, for getting me out of a muddle when I hadn't properly defined or called a function. A situation that left me fumbling for a doorhandle in a dark roo for a couple of hours! Thanks muchly.
